This course will introduce the basic structures and tools of the newest GIS software, ArcGIS Pro, an advanced map-making system which allows one to integrate, analyze and display spatial data, for a variety of functions. We will cover geospatial concepts, basic map design, geo-databases, importing spatial and attribute data, geocoding, spatial data processing, and simple spatial analysis. In the context of this new software, we will also look at the previous standard software: ArcMap, as well as Q-GIS, and AGOL (online). 

Beyond this, the course will explore two deeper issues: first, the potential that GIS has to reveal and precipitate creative thinking both in design and research. We will develop strategies for innovative uses of GIS exploring spatial methodologies in creativity and innovation translated to the world of mapping.  Secondly, in collaboration with local entrepreneurs or a social research team, we will investigate ways to use the modeling of tangible spatial systems as a research tool to make visible new spatial structures not only in geographic but environmental, cultural, or economic spheres. Using the classroom as a research base we will explore how mapping can be used to uncover sustainable urban patterns, be they ecological, political, physical or social, developing the use of GIS as a support system for innovative spatial thinking in community based design of the built environment.  Students will not only develop basic GIS skills, but engage with the practice of research participation through spatial analysis.

- Disability Accommodations: Students needing academic accommodations for a disability must first register with Disability Accommodations & Success Strategies (DASS). Call 214- 768-1470 or [begin the process](http://www.smu.edu/Provost/ALEC/DASS). Once registered, students should then schedule an appointment with the professor as early in the semester as possible, present a DASS Accommodation Letter and make appropriate arrangements. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive and require advance notice to implement. 
- Religious Observance: Religiously observant students wishing to be absent on holidays that require missing class should notify their professors in writing at the beginning of the semester, and should discuss with them, in advance, acceptable ways of making up any work missed because of the absence. (See University Policy No. 1.9.)
- Excused Absences for University Extracurricular Activities: Students participating in an officially sanctioned, scheduled University extracurricular activity should be given the opportunity to make up class assignments or other graded assignments missed as a result of their participation. It is the responsibility of the student to make arrangements with the instructor prior to any missed scheduled examination or other missed assignment for making up the work. (University Undergraduate Catalogue)

- Student Learning Outcomes: Please include in your syllabi all student learning outcomes, both those specific to your course, as well as those that satisfy major and general education requirements.
